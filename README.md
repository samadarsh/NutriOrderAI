# NutriOrder AI

AI-powered fitness meal ordering agent that intelligently discovers and executes food orders based on user goals like protein intake, budget, and dietary preferences.

---

## 🚀 Problem

Users struggle to consistently find meals that match:
- Daily protein targets
- Budget constraints
- Time availability
- Healthy eating habits

Food ordering apps provide options — but not decision-making.

---

## 💡 Solution

NutriOrder AI acts as an intelligent agent that:

- Understands user intent (e.g., “high protein meal under ₹300”)
- Filters and ranks meals based on nutrition, price, and delivery time
- Automatically executes food orders using Swiggy MCP

---

## 🧠 Core Features

- 🥩 High-protein meal discovery
- 💰 Budget-aware optimization
- ⏱️ Time-aware ordering (fast delivery filtering)
- 🤖 AI-driven decision making
- 🛒 End-to-end ordering automation

---

## ⚙️ Architecture

User → Frontend → AI Agent → Swiggy MCP → Order Execution

### Flow:
1. User inputs goal (protein, budget, preference)
2. AI agent converts input into structured constraints
3. Swiggy MCP tools are called:
   - search_restaurants
   - search_menu
   - add_to_cart
   - place_order
4. Meals are ranked using a nutrition + cost scoring logic
5. Final recommendation is shown → order executed on confirmation
