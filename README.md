# NutriOrder AI 🥗

AI-powered nutrition-aware food ordering agent that recommends high-protein meals based on user goals, budget, and preferences, and places confirmed orders through Swiggy MCP.

---

## 🚀 Problem

Users struggle to consistently find meals that match:
- Daily protein targets  
- Budget constraints  
- Delivery time expectations  
- Healthy eating habits  

Food ordering apps provide options, but not intelligent decision-making.

---

## 💡 Solution

NutriOrder AI acts as an AI-driven decision layer on top of Swiggy, enabling users to:

- Discover meals aligned with fitness goals such as high protein or lower calorie options  
- Stay within budget  
- Reduce decision fatigue  
- Order efficiently with AI-assisted recommendations

## ⚙️ Architecture

User → Frontend → AI Agent → Address Resolution → Swiggy MCP Food Server → Nutrition Scoring → Cart → User Confirmation → Order Placement  

### 🔄 Flow

1. User inputs goal, budget, and dietary preference  
2. AI agent converts input into structured constraints  
3. Resolve delivery location using `get_addresses`  
4. Discover restaurants using `search_restaurants`  
5. Retrieve menu data using `get_restaurant_menu` or `search_menu`  
6. Rank meals using protein, price, delivery time, and preferences  
7. Build cart using `update_food_cart`  
8. Verify cart using `get_food_cart`  
9. Require explicit user confirmation  
10. Place order using `place_food_order`  
11. Track order using `track_food_order`  

### 🧪 Current MVP Note

The current local scaffold stops at recommendation + mock cart preparation.  
Real order placement and tracking will be enabled after MCP access.

## ⚠️ Compliance & Safety

- Orders are placed **only after explicit user confirmation**  
- Cart is verified before placing an order  
- Food cart is tied to a single restaurant  
- No blind retries on order placement (non-idempotent)  
- COD support will be handled during live integration
