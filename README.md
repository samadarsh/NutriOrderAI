# 🍽️ BiteWise

BiteWise is a food intelligence platform that helps people decide what to eat, what to cook, and what to restock.

It contains two product modules:

- **NutriOrder AI** — personal nutrition-aware Swiggy food ordering.
- **SmartPantry AI** — household pantry, recipe, grocery list, and Instamart cart-preview intelligence.

The platform uses Swiggy MCP as the execution layer while keeping order placement behind explicit review, environment locks, and safety checks.

## ⚙️ Staging Status

Food MCP staging is ready for credential validation. Until Swiggy staging credentials are active:

- Keep `USE_MOCK_MCP=true`
- Keep `ALLOW_PLACE_ORDER=false`
- Use mock/demo mode for local walkthroughs

When staging credentials arrive, follow `STAGING_READINESS.md` and use `scripts/validate_credentials.py` before running real staging validation.

> **Note**: Real Instamart checkout is intentionally not implemented yet. SmartPantry AI currently provides pantry intelligence, grocery grouping, and mock cart preview only.
